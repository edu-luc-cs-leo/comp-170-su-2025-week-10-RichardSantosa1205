I approached this course with the mindset of someone who enjoys their work — motivated, committed, and eager to grow. From the start, I treated each class like a professional commitment, doing my best to stay on track and contribute meaningfully. Reflecting on the term, I believe my performance demonstrates consistent effort, noticeable growth, and engagement with the material.

In terms of attendance and punctuality, I made it a priority to be present and on time for class. However I missed quuite a few classes, this was due to time management issues, and a drop in dedication towards the course, though missing classes I still took the appropriate meassures to catch up promptly. I viewed each class as an opportunity to build on my understanding, so being there and being on time felt important not just for me, but out of respect for the learning environment.

My participation and engagement in class were active and thoughtful, in the begenning. However, as the course went on I wained from said path, this is due to again dedication issues and lack of interest from myself, however I did make an effort to answer questions when I could and ask them when I needed clarity. I also took initiative outside of class, occasionally exploring problems beyond the assigned homework or revisiting concepts I found challenging. This helped me stay connected to the material and showed me where I could improve.

I also prioritized being fully present and focused during class. I avoided distractions — especially during Zoom sessions — and made sure to treat class time with the same focus I would give to an in-person meeting. When I encountered difficulties, I sought help, whether by sending emails, or talking to classmates. These actions helped me stay on top of the workload and refine my understanding.

With regard to assignment timeliness, I consistently submitted work on or before the due dates. Staying organized helped me avoid falling behind, and even when an assignment was more complex or time-consuming, I planned ahead to make sure it was done on time. I took deadlines seriously, both as a sign of professionalism and out of respect for the learning process. I did however missed an assignment, and this was an oversight on my part as I thought I could finish the work on time, however I was not able to. I as able to bounce back and plan my assignments accordingly moving forward, and have not missed an assignment since.

One area where I feel I made real progress was in reflection and growth. Though in the begening I had issues with this new style of grading, after the 3rd week I was able to fully adjust and I regularly reviewed the posted solutions after each assignment and compared them to my own submissions. This allowed me to spot patterns in my mistakes, and I worked to apply those lessons to future assignments. Over time, this habit helped me strengthen not only my technical skills but also my approach to problem-solving.

In terms of code quality, I made a conscious effort to write clean, readable, and functional code. I met assignment requirements consistently and improved based on feedback. Early in the term, I noticed areas where my logic could be tighter, my formatting clearer, along with my issues with writing clear comments and doc strings, I then worked on refining those skills. By the end of the course, I was more confident in my ability to write code that was not only correct but also well-structured.

Looking back, I’m especially proud of how I grew post the mid-semester feed back given to me, it showed me that I needed to strive for a better outcome as the feed back given was quite poor. from that moment on I was set on producing the best work forward both through my code in the weekly homework, and the dedication and punctuality towards attending classes. The mid-semester review was a wake up call, and it allowed me to grow further towards a better future.

Overall, I believe I’ve shown strong performance in this course — not perfect, but committed and steadily improving. If I were to assign myself a grade, I’d choose one that reflects consistent effort, a growth mindset, and active engagement with both the material and the class community.

Based on the above, I propose a B as my final grade.
