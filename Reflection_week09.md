Looking back at my code compared to the provided solution, I realize there are several areas where I can do better as a programmer. While my functions were mostly correct and clear, I missed some key opportunities to improve efficiency, handle edge cases more carefully, and match standard conventions. For example, in my sum_of_digits function, I handled negative inputs, showing my attention to edge cases. However, I didn’t explore cleaner or shorter ways of writing the function, like using a ternary operator or avoiding unnecessary variables.

In my count_occurrences function, the logic was sound, but I overlooked cases like a None input, which could cause my code to crash. The other version handled those gracefully. Also, it included multiple optimized alternatives, which I didn’t think to try. Seeing that reminded me that writing working code is just the beginning — writing efficient, clean code matters too.

For the factorial and Fibonacci problems, I felt confident. However, in my Fibonacci function, I used a less common starting condition, defining F(1)=1 and F(2)=2 instead of the more standard F(0)=0 and F(1)=1. I learned how small differences like that can make my code less clear to others.

Overall, this comparison helped me see that clean code, proper testing, and handling all cases are just as important as getting the logic right. I want to keep improving in all of those areas.
